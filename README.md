# NICU-Sepsis-ML-Project
Project to predict Sepsis and Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) using various Machine Learning Algorithms

* Late-Onset Neonatal Sepsis prediction using supervised learning techniques – Research Fellow
▪ Presented at INFORMS Annual meeting 2016 Nashville, TN, Operations Analysis in Healthcare. Built
model to predict Sepsis and Necrotizing Enterocolitis in infants implementing various machine learning
algorithms. The results implied potential clinical applications for the NICU to implement this on real-time
heart rate data (currently working on publication 2018).
* To Do: Add MatLab and Python programming files.
